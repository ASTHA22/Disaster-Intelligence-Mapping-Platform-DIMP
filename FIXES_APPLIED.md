# 🔧 Fixes Applied - Mumbai + Search + Data Ingestion

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Social Media Now Shows Mumbai ✅
**Fixed:** `backend/data_generator.py`
- Added Mumbai-specific social media posts
- Posts now mention: Colaba, Bandra, Andheri, Juhu, Worli, etc.
- Automatically uses Mumbai posts when location is Mumbai

**Sample Posts:**
- "Urgent! Building collapsed at Colaba..."
- "Severe flooding in Bandra area..."
- "Road to JJ Hospital completely blocked..."
- "Andheri market area under 3 feet water..."

### 2. Search Bar Issue ✅
**Problem:** Search bar component created but frontend not restarted

**Solution:** Restart frontend to load new components

```bash
# Stop frontend (if running)
# Ctrl+C in the terminal running npm start

# Restart
cd frontend
npm start
```

**What Search Bar Does:**
- Real-time search through disaster zones
- Autocomplete dropdown
- Click to zoom to location
- Shows severity & damage scores
- Smooth animations

### 3. Data Ingestion Explained ✅
**Created:** `DATA_INGESTION_EXPLAINED.md`

**Summary:**
- ✅ Satellite imagery: Upload API + ResNet50 processing
- ✅ Drone imagery: Upload API + video processing ready
- ✅ Social media: NLP pipeline + DistilBERT analysis
- ✅ All infrastructure ready for real data sources
- ✅ Just need API credentials to connect live feeds

## 🚀 How to See the Fixes

### Step 1: Backend (Already Restarted)
```bash
# Backend is running with Mumbai data
curl http://localhost:8000/api/social-feed
# You'll see Mumbai locations in posts
```

### Step 2: Restart Frontend
```bash
# In the terminal running frontend:
# Press Ctrl+C to stop

# Then restart:
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Everything
```
Open: http://localhost:3000

You'll see:
✅ Search bar at top of left panel
✅ Mumbai locations on map
✅ Mumbai social media posts (right panel)
✅ All features working
```

## 🧪 Test the Fixes

### Test 1: Social Media (Mumbai)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/social-feed | python3 -m json.tool
```
**Expected:** Posts mentioning Colaba, Bandra, Andheri, etc.

### Test 2: Search Bar (After Frontend Restart)
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Look for search bar at top of left panel
3. Type "Bandra"
4. See results
5. Click to zoom

### Test 3: Data Ingestion
```bash
# Test image analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/analyze-image \
  -F "file=@image.jpg"

# Test social media analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/analyze-social-media \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Building collapsed in Bandra!"}'
```
