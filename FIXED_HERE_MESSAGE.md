# ✅ HERE API Message Fixed!

## Issue
The map was showing an old message: "Ready for HERE Maps integration - Add your HERE API key tomorrow"

## Solution
Updated the message to show the correct status:

**Old Message:**
```

```

**New Message:**
```
✅ HERE Maps API Active
Routing, Isoline & Geocoding enabled • Real-time disaster tracking
```
