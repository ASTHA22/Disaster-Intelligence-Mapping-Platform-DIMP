## 🎬 Demo Script (Updated)

### **Opening:**
"Our platform processes real-time disaster data from NASA and USGS - these are ACTUAL disasters happening right now."

### **Show Map:**
"These markers represent 35 real disasters - 20 active fires detected by NASA satellites across India in the last 3 hours, and 15 earthquakes from USGS in the last 24 hours."

### **Highlight Authenticity:**
"This is not simulation - every marker you see is a real disaster. The fires are in West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh. NASA FIRMS is the same data source used by fire departments worldwide."

### **Show API:**
[Open http://localhost:8000/docs]
"You can see our API returns 100% real-time data with source attribution - NASA FIRMS for fires, USGS for earthquakes."

### **Emphasize:**
"We're demonstrating real capability - our platform can ingest, process, and visualize live disaster data from authoritative sources."

## 🧪 Test Your Data

### **Test 1: Check Count**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/disaster-zones | python3 -c "import sys, json; data=json.load(sys.stdin); print(f'Total: {data[\"count\"]}, Sources: {data[\"sources\"]}')"
```

**Expected:**
```
Total: 35, Sources: ['NASA FIRMS', 'USGS', 'Open-Meteo']
```

### **Test 2: View Real Fires**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/disaster-zones | python3 -c "import sys, json; data=json.load(sys.stdin); fires=[z for z in data['zones'] if z.get('source')=='NASA FIRMS']; print(f'NASA Fires: {len(fires)}'); [print(f\"  {z['name']}\") for z in fires[:5]]"
```

**Expected:**
```
NASA Fires: 20
  Fire at 23.76, 86.41
  Fire at 23.78, 86.21
  Fire at 23.68, 86.40
  ...
```

### **Test 3: View in Browser**
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```
Click `/api/disaster-zones` → Try it out → Execute

## 🔍 Search Function

### **What to Search For:**

**Fires:**
- "fire" → Shows all NASA fires
- "23.76" → Specific coordinates
- "86.41" → Specific coordinates

**Earthquakes:**
- "earthquake" → Shows USGS earthquakes
- Location names from earthquake data

**Note:** No more "Bandra" or "Andheri" since we removed Mumbai simulation!

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

### **1. Authenticity:**
"Every data point is real - no simulation, no mock data."

### **2. Sources:**
"NASA FIRMS is used by fire departments globally. USGS is the authoritative source for earthquake data."

### **3. Real-Time:**
"NASA updates every 3 hours, USGS updates in real-time. Our platform fetches and processes this continuously."

### **4. Capability:**
"This demonstrates our platform's ability to integrate with authoritative data sources and process live disaster intelligence."

### **5. Production-Ready:**
"We're not just showing a concept - this is working with real data right now."
