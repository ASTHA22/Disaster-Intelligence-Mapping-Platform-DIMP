# 🗺️ Mapbox Attribution - It's OK!

## ✅ Why Mapbox Logo Appears

**The Issue:**
You're seeing the Mapbox logo even though we're using CartoDB tiles.

**Why:**
- `react-map-gl` is built on top of `mapbox-gl-js` library
- The Mapbox logo is part of the rendering engine, NOT the map data
- It's like using Chrome browser (shows Chrome logo) to view any website

## 🎯 What's Actually Happening

### Map Stack:
```
Your Disaster Data (markers, zones)
        ↓
CartoDB Tiles (the actual map imagery) ✅ FREE
        ↓
react-map-gl (React wrapper)
        ↓
mapbox-gl-js (rendering engine) ← Shows Mapbox logo
        ↓
Browser Display
```

**Analogy:**
- **Map Data:** CartoDB (free, open)
- **Rendering Engine:** Mapbox GL JS (like using Chrome to browse)
- **Logo:** Shows because of the engine, not the data

## ✅ Is This Allowed?

### YES! Here's why:

**1. You're NOT using Mapbox API**
- ✅ No Mapbox API calls
- ✅ No Mapbox tiles
- ✅ No Mapbox data
- ✅ Using CartoDB tiles (free)

**2. Mapbox GL JS is Open Source**
- ✅ BSD-3-Clause license
- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ Logo is part of the library
- ✅ Allowed in hackathons

**3. Common Practice**
- ✅ Many apps use mapbox-gl-js with other tile providers
- ✅ Uber, Airbnb, and others do this
- ✅ Standard industry practice

## 💡 What to Tell Judges

### If Asked: "Are you using Mapbox?"

**Answer:**
"We're using CartoDB for the map tiles, which is completely free and open-source. The Mapbox logo appears because we're using the Mapbox GL JS rendering engine - which is also open-source - but we're not making any Mapbox API calls or using their tile services. It's similar to how a website might show a Chrome logo even though the content isn't from Google. This is a standard industry practice used by companies like Uber and Airbnb."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Map data: CartoDB (free)
- ✅ Rendering engine: Mapbox GL JS (open source)
- ✅ No Mapbox API usage
- ✅ No costs
- ✅ Production-ready

## 🔍 How to Verify

### Check Network Tab (F12):

**What you'll see:**
```
✅ Requests to: basemaps.cartocdn.com (CartoDB tiles)
❌ NO requests to: api.mapbox.com (Mapbox API)
```

**This proves you're using CartoDB data, not Mapbox!**

## 🎯 Alternative Solutions (If Needed)

### Option 1: Keep Current Setup (RECOMMENDED)
- ✅ Works perfectly
- ✅ Professional quality
- ✅ Free and allowed
- ✅ Industry standard

### Option 2: Remove Logo with CSS (Not Recommended)
```css
.mapboxgl-ctrl-logo {
  display: none !important;
}
```
**Why not:** Violates Mapbox GL JS license terms

### Option 3: Switch to Leaflet (Time-consuming)
- Would need to rewrite entire map component
- Different API
- 2-3 hours of work
- Not worth it for hackathon

2. ✅ You're not using Mapbox API or tiles
3. ✅ You're using CartoDB (free) for map data
4. ✅ This is standard industry practice
5. ✅ No costs involved
6. ✅ Allowed in hackathons

### What You're Actually Using:
- ✅ CartoDB tiles (free, open)
- ✅ Mapbox GL JS engine (free, open source)
- ✅ React-map-gl wrapper (free, open source)

### What You're NOT Using:
- ❌ Mapbox API
- ❌ Mapbox tiles
- ❌ Mapbox services
- ❌ Any paid services

## 🎬 Demo Talking Points

### Emphasize:
"Our platform uses CartoDB for mapping - a free, open-source service used by NASA and the UN. The rendering is handled by Mapbox GL JS, which is an open-source library, but we're not using any Mapbox API services or tiles. This keeps our costs at zero while maintaining professional quality."

### If Pressed:
"You can see in the network tab that all map tile requests go to CartoDB, not Mapbox. The Mapbox logo is just part of the rendering library we're using, similar to how a website might show browser branding. This is the same approach used by Uber, Airbnb, and other major platforms."
