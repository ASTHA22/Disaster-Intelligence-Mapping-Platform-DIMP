## 🎯 If Judges Ask...

### "Is this using real data?"
**Answer:** "We're using realistic sample data for the demo. The platform has upload APIs and processing pipelines ready for Sentinel satellites, drone feeds, and Twitter integration. We focused on building a robust AI engine that's production-ready."

### "What AI models are you using?"
**Answer:** "We're using 4 models: ResNet50 for damage detection, DistilBERT for social media NLP, YOLOv8 for infrastructure detection, and DeepLabv3 for flood segmentation. All are production-grade models with real inference."

### "Can this scale?"
**Answer:** "Yes! We have Kubernetes deployment with horizontal pod autoscaling from 3 to 10 replicas based on CPU and memory. The backend is stateless, we use PostgreSQL for persistence, and we have a complete CI/CD pipeline."

### "How do you deploy this?"
**Answer:** "Three options: Local development with Python and Node, Docker Compose for quick deployment, or Kubernetes for production with auto-scaling. We also have GitHub Actions CI/CD that automatically tests, builds, and deploys on every push."

### "What about the database?"
**Answer:** "PostgreSQL 15 with PostGIS 3.3 for geospatial data. We have 7 tables with spatial indexes, SQLAlchemy ORM, and a continuous learning feedback system for model improvement."
