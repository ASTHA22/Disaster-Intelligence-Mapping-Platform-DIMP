- Social media intelligence gathering

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Phase 3: HERE Maps Integration

### Before:
- Basic Leaflet map
- No routing

- Manual coordinate entry

### After (HERE APIs):

#### 1. Routing API
```
Feature: Evacuation Route Calculation
Input: Origin (disaster zone) ‚Üí Destination (shelter)
Output: Optimal route with distance, duration, turn-by-turn
```

#### 2. Isoline API
```
Feature: Rescue Coverage Zones
Input: Rescue station location
Output: 5/10/15-minute reachable areas
Visual: Color-coded polygons on map
```

#### 3. Geocoding API
```
Feature: Address ‚Üî Coordinates
Input: "Dharavi, Mumbai"
Output: (19.0433, 72.8566)
```

#### 4. Map Image API (NEW!)
```
Feature: Cartographic Reference Images
Input: Disaster image + location
Process: Compare with HERE satellite imagery
Output: Change detection (flooding, damage, vegetation loss)
```

### Impact:
- Professional-grade routing
- Visual coverage analysis
- Accurate geolocation
- **AI-powered disaster comparison using HERE's cartographic data**

---

## üé® Phase 4: UI/UX Polish

- ‚úÖ **Export Options** - PDF, JSON, CSV
- ‚úÖ **Search Functionality** - Find zones quickly
- ‚úÖ **Priority Alerts** - Color-coded severity

---

## üìà Phase 5: Data Intelligence

### Dynamic Statistics (Not Hardcoded!)

**Before:**
```python
statistics = {
    "affected_area": 500,  # Hardcoded
    "displaced": 10000     # Hardcoded
}
```

**After:**
```python
# Calculated from real data
total_affected_area = sum(zone.affected_area for zone in zones)
displaced_population = sum(disp.displaced_count for disp in displacement)
rescue_operations = sum(1 for alert in alerts 
                       if alert.category == 'rescue' 
                       and alert.status == 'active')
```

### Impact:
- Real-time accuracy
- Data-driven decisions
- Transparent calculations

---

## üî¨ Phase 6: Image Comparison (Latest!)

### The Innovation:

**Problem:** How to validate disaster images?

**Solution:** Compare against HERE's cartographic baseline!

### How It Works:

```
1. User uploads disaster image (flood, damage, etc.)
   ‚Üì
2. System fetches HERE satellite reference for same location
   ‚Üì
3. AI compares pixel-by-pixel
   ‚Üì
4. Detects changes:
   - Water increase (flooding)
   - Vegetation loss (fires)
   - Infrastructure damage (earthquakes)
   ‚Üì
5. Returns quantified results (% change, severity, analysis)
```

### Example Output:
```
Change Detected: 42.5%
Severity: HIGH

Detected Changes:
‚úÖ Water Increase (Flooding)
‚úÖ Infrastructure Damage
‚ùå Vegetation Loss

AI Analysis:
"HIGH: Significant changes detected (>30% pixel difference) | 
Possible flooding detected (increased dark/water areas) | 
Structural changes detected (texture/edge differences)"
```

### Why This Matters:
- **Objective validation** using HERE's authoritative data
- **Quantifiable results** (exact percentage)
- **Automated detection** (no manual inspection)
- **Multiple disaster types** (floods, fires, earthquakes)
