# HERE Map Image API - Cartographic Reference & Disaster Comparison

## Overview

Based on mentor feedback, we've integrated **HERE Map Image API** to use cartographic reference images for disaster detection and comparison. This allows us to:

1. **Fetch reference images** from HERE's cartographic database (satellite, terrain, normal maps)
2. **Compare disaster images** against these references to detect changes
3. **Identify specific changes** like flooding, vegetation loss, infrastructure damage

## How It Works

### 1. Reference Image Retrieval

```python
GET /api/here/reference-image?lat=19.0760&lon=72.8777&zoom=15&map_type=satellite.day
```

**Returns:** Base64-encoded satellite/terrain image from HERE's cartographic database

**Use Case:** Get the "before disaster" reference image for any location

### 2. Disaster Image Comparison

```python
POST /api/here/compare-disaster-image
Form Data:
  - file: disaster_image.jpg (uploaded drone/satellite photo)
  - lat: 19.0760
  - lon: 72.8777
  - zoom: 15
```

**Process:**
1. Upload disaster image (from drone, satellite, or ground camera)
2. System fetches HERE reference image for exact same location
3. AI compares both images pixel-by-pixel
4. Detects changes: water increase, vegetation loss, structural damage
5. Returns detailed analysis

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "change_percentage": 42.5,
  "changes_detected": {
    "water_increase": true,
    "vegetation_loss": false,
    "infrastructure_damage": true,
    "color_shift_detected": true
  },
  "analysis": "HIGH: Significant changes detected (>30% pixel difference) | Possible flooding detected (increased dark/water areas) | Structural changes detected (texture/edge differences)"
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### File: `backend/here_image_service.py`

**Key Functions:**

1. **`get_reference_image(lat, lon, zoom, map_type)`**
   - Fetches cartographic reference from HERE Map Image API
   - Supports: satellite, terrain, normal, hybrid maps
   - Returns base64-encoded image

2. **`compare_disaster_image(disaster_path, lat, lon, zoom)`**
   - Loads disaster image
   - Fetches HERE reference for same location
   - Performs pixel-level comparison
   - Detects specific change types

3. **`_analyze_changes(disaster_img, ref_img)`**
   - Water detection (darker areas = flooding)
   - Vegetation analysis (green channel comparison)
   - Infrastructure damage (edge/texture changes)
   - Color shift detection

### Change Detection Algorithms

#### 1. Flood Detection
```python
# Darker areas in disaster image indicate water
water_change = np.mean(disaster_gray - ref_gray)
if water_change < -20:  # Significant darkening
    changes["water_increase"] = True
```

#### 2. Vegetation Loss
```python
# Green channel comparison
green_loss = np.mean(ref_img[:,:,1]) - np.mean(disaster_img[:,:,1])
if green_loss > 10:  # Green decreased
    changes["vegetation_loss"] = True
```

#### 3. Infrastructure Damage
```python
# Texture/edge changes indicate structural damage
edge_change = np.std(disaster_gray) - np.std(ref_gray)
if abs(edge_change) > 15:
    changes["infrastructure_damage"] = True
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Flood Detection
**Scenario:** Heavy rains in Mumbai

**Process:**
1. Drone captures aerial photo of flooded area
2. Upload to `/api/here/compare-disaster-image`
3. System compares with HERE's pre-disaster satellite image
4. Detects water increase (darker pixels)
5. Returns flood severity percentage

### 2. Infrastructure Damage Assessment
**Scenario:** Earthquake damages buildings

**Process:**
1. Upload post-earthquake satellite image
2. Compare with HERE reference
3. Detect structural changes (edge/texture differences)
4. Identify damaged areas

### 3. Vegetation Loss (Wildfire)
**Scenario:** Forest fire destroys vegetation

**Process:**
1. Upload post-fire image
2. Compare green channel with reference
3. Calculate vegetation loss percentage
4. Map affected areas

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/here/reference-image` | GET | Get HERE cartographic reference image |
| `/api/here/compare-disaster-image` | POST | Compare disaster image with reference |
| `/api/here/area-comparison` | GET | Get reference for area analysis |

## Example Usage

### Python
```python
import requests

# Get reference image
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/here/reference-image",
    params={
        "lat": 19.0760,
        "lon": 72.8777,
        "zoom": 15,
        "map_type": "satellite.day"
    }
)
reference = response.json()

# Compare disaster image
with open("flood_image.jpg", "rb") as f:
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/api/here/compare-disaster-image",
        files={"file": f},
        data={"lat": 19.0760, "lon": 72.8777, "zoom": 15}
    )
comparison = response.json()

print(f"Change detected: {comparison['change_percentage']}%")
print(f"Flooding: {comparison['changes_detected']['water_increase']}")
```

### cURL
```bash
# Get reference image
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/here/reference-image?lat=19.0760&lon=72.8777&zoom=15&map_type=satellite.day"

# Compare disaster image
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/here/compare-disaster-image?lat=19.0760&lon=72.8777&zoom=15" \
  -F "file=@disaster_image.jpg"
```

## Benefits

1. **Objective Comparison**: Uses HERE's authoritative cartographic data as baseline
2. **Automated Detection**: AI identifies specific change types automatically
3. **Quantifiable Results**: Returns exact percentage of change
4. **Multiple Map Types**: Satellite, terrain, normal, hybrid views
5. **Global Coverage**: Works anywhere HERE has map data

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
cd backend
python test_here_image.py
```

This will:
- Fetch reference images from HERE
- Test area comparison
- Validate API endpoints

## Integration with DIMP

This feature enhances DIMP's disaster intelligence by:

1. **Validating AI predictions** against authoritative cartographic data
2. **Quantifying disaster impact** with pixel-level precision
3. **Providing before/after comparison** for damage assessment
4. **Supporting multiple disaster types** (floods, fires, earthquakes)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time change detection with streaming images
- [ ] Multi-temporal analysis (track changes over time)
- [ ] Machine learning for better change classification
- [ ] Integration with frontend for visual comparison
- [ ] Automated alerts when change threshold exceeded
